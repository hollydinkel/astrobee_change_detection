# Repository for Processing Astrobee `.bag` Data

## Usage

Install the ![Astrobee flight software](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee). Additional instructions for using the Astrobee flight software with Docker are ![here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wx54si5_24rz0kJie31X54PIk_k_owT6qzlziGnAWYc/edit?usp=sharing). Clone this data processing repository into the astrobee flight software repository:

```bash
export ASTROBEE_WS=$HOME/astrobee
cd $ASTROBEE_WS && git clone https://github.com/hollydinkel/astrobee_data_processing
```

The steps for creating a dataset to use with Fast Change Detection are included below. Download a dated raw dataset from ![here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mCxaicloRZOwuGWVxp52GwxBaCMDVEri?usp=sharing). Unzip the dataset into  Note that the survey number (e.g., 1, 2, 3), the date (e.g., 20230419), and the robot name (e.g., bsharp) must be specified in each step. The first four steps can be performed in a docker container where the running container is mounted to a local directory. The provided `process.sh` script runs these four steps. The last step should be performed locally if the FastCD workspace is built outside of the container.

1. Perform initial extraction of images and poses from bag data to folder:
```bash
export DATA=$ASTROBEE_WS/src/astrobee_data_processing
export SURVEY=[survey]
export DATE=[date]
export ROBOT=[robot]
cd $DATA && python3 scripts/poses_to_file.py $SURVEY $DATE $ROBOT
```

2. Process sequential images to remove images where frames did not move much between images:

```bash
cd $ASTROBEE_WS && source devel/setup.bash
rosrun sparse_mapping process_sequential_images.py $DATA/data/$DATE/$ROBOT/bayer/survey$SURVEY $ASTROBEE_WS/src/astrobee/config
```

3. Process sequential poses so that final poses are close in time (timestamps are close) to the image timestamps:

```bash
cd $DATA
python3 scripts/process_sequential_poses.py $SURVEY $DATE $ROBOT
```

4. Rename all images in each folder to match what FastCD expects:
```bash
cd $DATA/data/$DATE/$ROBOT/bayer/survey$SURVEY
ls -v | nl -v 0 | while read n f; do mv -n "$f" "Image$n.JPG"; done
```

5. Create `cameras.xml` file used in FastCD. Make sure to change the `fastcd_data_directory` variable in line 21 before running this.

```bash
cd $DATA
python3 scripts/create_cameras_xml.py $SURVEY $DATE $ROBOT
```
